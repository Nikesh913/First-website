            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>One thing I really enjoy is music. I listen to all kinds of 
                    music, and I am very involved in music. I have been learning 
                    Indian Carnatic Music for the last 10 years. I am very passionate
                     about singing. In addition to singing, I also play the violin and 
                     the piano. I have been playing the violin for the 5 years, and 
                     I have been playing the piano for the last 7 years. Music has 
                     had a very big impact on my life because I have been exposed to 
                     it all my life.
                </li>
                <li>I have also been doing karate for 9 years. I earned my black belt
                     about 2 years ago, and it was very exhausting. To earn our black 
                     belt we had to take four tests. The first test was about 4 hours, 
                     the second test was about 6 hours, the third test was about 8 hours,
                      and the final test was 11 hours. Though the journey was long, it was 
                      definitely worth it because I was able to learn how to defend myself,
                       and I made many friends there.
                </li>
                <p>In addition to loving music and karate, I also have so much fun 
                    competing in track meets. Eighth grade was the first year I started
                     track, and I was able to really enjoy it because I was doing it with
                      my closest friends. We made so many memories at track, and I had the 
                      chance to see which events I would like to participate in during high
                       school. It also made me realize that I might want to join the cross 
                       country team as well in high school.
